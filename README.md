# NucTools

## NucTools is a software package for analysis of chromatin feature occupancy profiles from high-throughput sequencing data
 
Recent advancements in high-throughput sequencing methods create a vast amount of data in which numerous chromatin features are mapped along the genome. The results are frequently analysed by creating binarized data sets that link the presence/absence of a given readout to specific genomic loci. It is currently a challenge in the field to cope with continuous distributions of deep sequencing chromatin readouts, and to integrate the different types of datasets to reveal linkages between them. Here we introduce the NucTools suite of Perl scripts and a stand-alone visualisation program for a nucleosome-centred downstream analysis of deep sequencing data. NucTools accounts for the continuous distribution of nucleosome occupancy. Furthermore, it is useful to associate nucleosome occupancy with other chromatin features like transcription factor binding, histone modifications or DNA methylation.
