  "body": "# NucTools\r\n\r\n## NucTools is a software package for analysis of chromatin feature occupancy profiles from high-throughput sequencing data\r\n \r\nRecent advancements in high-throughput sequencing methods create a vast amount of data in which numerous chromatin features are mapped along the genome. The results are frequently analysed by creating binarized data sets that link the presence/absence of a given readout to specific genomic loci. It is currently a challenge in the field to cope with continuous distributions of deep sequencing chromatin readouts, and to integrate the different types of datasets to reveal linkages between them. Here we introduce the NucTools suite of Perl scripts and a stand-alone visualisation program for a nucleosome-centred downstream analysis of deep sequencing data. NucTools accounts for the continuous distribution of nucleosome occupancy. Furthermore, it is useful to associate nucleosome occupancy with other chromatin features like transcription factor binding, histone modifications or DNA methylation.\r\n\r\n## Additional information\r\n\r\nAdditional information, publications references and short description of each script from the toolbox can be found here:\r\nhttp://www.generegulation.info/index.php/nuctools\r\n\r\n**PLEASE NOTE:**\r\n*we are currently preparing manuscript and will add here more information, usage instruction and test data set soon.\r\nThe project is under development now.*\r\n\r\n#### Planned modifications:\r\nThere are several changes has been planned and partially implemented:\r\n- implement GZIP support for all input/output files generated by the pipeline scripts \r\n- implement gapped OCC format support to all relevant scripts\r\n- extend NucTools documentation and usage examples with Perl POD package\r\n- unify pipeline scripts input parameters using Perl GETOPT package\r\n\r\n#### Future possible modifications:\r\n- BAM files support\r\n- parallel processing (beautiful codes snippets for implementation of parallel processing of BAM files with Perl one can find here: https://genomebytes.wordpress.com/2013/07/24/multi-thread-access-of-bam-files-using-perl-and-samtools/ )\r\n- NucTools automated package installation with make \r\n\r\n### Developers: \r\nYevhen Vainshtein and Vladimir B.
