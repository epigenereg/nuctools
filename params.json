The results are frequently analysed by creating binarized data sets that link the presence/absence of a given readout to specific genomic loci. It is currently a challenge in the field to cope with continuous distributions of deep sequencing chromatin readouts, and to integrate the different types of datasets to reveal linkages between them. Here we introduce the NucTools suite of Perl scripts and a stand-alone visualisation program for a nucleosome-centred downstream analysis of deep sequencing data. NucTools accounts for the continuous distribution of nucleosome occupancy. Furthermore, it is useful to associate nucleosome occupancy with other chromatin features like transcription factor binding, histone modifications or DNA methylation.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n## SYSTEM REQUIREMENT\r\n\r\nLinux (2.6 kernel or later) or Mac (OSX 10.6 Snow Leopard or later) operating system\r\nwith minimal 16 GB of RAM is recommended*. Perl v5.8 or above is required.\r\n\r\nThe C/C++ compiling enviroment might be required for installing dependencies, such as bedtools. Systems may vary.\r\nPlease assure that your system has the essential software building packages (e.g. build-essential\r\nfor Fedora, XCODE for Mac...etc) installed properly before running the installing \r\nscript.\r\n\r\nNucTools was tested successfully on our Linux servers (CentOS release 6.7 w/ Perl v5.10.1; \r\nFedora release 22 w/ Perl v5.20.3) and Macbook Pro laptops (MAC OSX 10.11 w/ XCODE v5.1).\r\n\r\n*Memory requirments depends on the experimental system. For big genomes performance will increase greatly on machines with more memory. For example, processing of 22 mouse chromosomes, with the sequencing library size about 75 000 000 reads occupy at peak load around 60-70 Gb of RAM. Important to mention, the performance is very dependent on HDD read-write speed. Therefore the parallel running of many samples at once recomended only on the server-like system or computational clusters with RAID arrays, allowing real multithreaded read-write access to HDDs array.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n## QUICK START \r\n\r\nThis is an example of profiling a \"test.bed\" file using NucTools. The testing BED file comes along with the NucTools package\r\nin the \"test\" directory. More details are stated in the INSTRUCTION section.\r\n\r\n1. Obtaining NucTools package:\r\n        $ git clone https://github.com/homeveg/nuctools.git NucTools\r\n\r\n2. Installing NucTools:\r\n        the NucTools package does not require installation. It is a collection of individual Perl scripts which can be executed individually.\r\n\r\n3. Generate a genome annotation table using providing R script:\r\n        $ Rscript misc/LoadAnnotation.BioMart.R\r\n\r\n4. Prepare BED files from BAM files with external application (optionally) \r\n    1. merge multiple replicates to one BAM file and sort by reads name:\r\n        $ samtools merge -n /Path_to_folder_with/BAM/test_sorted.bam /Path_to_folder_with/BAM/test.rp1.bam /Path_to_folder_with/BAM/test.rp2.bam /Path_to_folder_with/BAM/test.rp3.bam\r\n    2. converted sorted BAM file to BED\r\n        $ \tbedtools bamtobed -i /Path_to_folder_with/BAM/test_sorted.bam | pigz > /Path_to_folder_with/BED/test_sorted.bed.gz\r\n\r\n5. Running NucTools:\r\n    1. Extend single-end reads to the average DNA fragment size (100)\r\n        $ extend_SE_reads.pl -in test.bed -out test.ext.bed.gz\r\n    2. Extract ndividual chromosomes from whole genome BED\r\n        $ extract_chr_bed.pl -in test.ext.bed.gz -out test -d /Path_to_folder_with/BED/ -p chr \r\n    3. Convert all BED files to occupancy OCC files avereging nucleosomes occupancy values over the window of size 10\r\n        $ bed2occupancy_average.pl -in /Path_to_folder_with/BED/ -odir /Path_to_folder_with/OCC -dir -use -w 10\r\n    4. Calculate aggregate profiles and aligned occupancy matrices for each chromosome individually \r\n        $ aggregate_profile.pl -reg genome_annotation.tab -idC 0 -chrC 4 --strC 7 -sC 8 -eC 9 -pbN -lsN -lS <SeqLibSize> -chr 1 -al /Path_to_folder_with/OCC/chr1.test.occ_matrix -av /Path_to_folder_with/OCC/chr1.test.aggregate -in /Path_to_folder_with/OCC/chr1.test.w10.occ.gz -upD 1000 -downD 1000\r\n    5. Paste together aggregate profiles of each chromosome in one file and add a header\r\n       * Generate a header\r\n        $ ls /Path_to_folder_with/OCC/*1000_1000.txt | perl -n -e 'if(/.*(chr.*)\\.test.*/gm) { print $1, \"\\t\"; }' | perl -n -e 'if( /(.*)\\t$/g )  { print $1}' > /Path_to_folder_with/OCC/test.all.occ.txt\r\n        $ echo \"\" >> /Path_to_folder_with/OCC/test.all.occ.txt\r\n       * paste all aggregate profiles to one file\r\n        $ paste /Path_to_folder_with/OCC/*1000_1000.txt >> /Path_to_folder_with/OCC/test.all.occ.txt\r\n\r\n6. Optionally: \r\nVisualize aggregate profiles and run K-mean cluster analysis on aligned occupancy matrixes with the MatLab-based ClusterMaps Building Tool (provided as a part of NucTools package). \r\n[Download link](https://github.com/homeveg/nuctools/raw/master/CMB/ClusterMaps_Builder_src.zip)\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nthe NucTools suite for a nucleosome-centred downstream analysis of deep sequencing data is primarily Perl-based, and require at least Perl v5.8 with dependencies installed properly (listed in README_FULL.md).\r\nA visualisation program is written on MatLab and requires either full MatLab insatllation or can be provided as a standolone application with web-installer compiled for MacOS X 10.9 or later.\r\nNucTools utilize whole genome [BED](https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat#format1) files.\r\n\r\n**Optional external applications:**\r\n    \r\n- [SamTools](http://samtools.sourceforge.net/) - merge and sort BAM files\r\n- [bedtools](http://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) - convert BAM to BED\r\n- [PIGZ](http://zlib.net/pigz/) - a parallel implementation of gzip for modern multi-processor, multi-core machines\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n## Running NucTools\r\n\r\nOne can devide the NucTools pipeline to 3 major steps: (1) prepare input OCC files (2) calculate aggregate profiles and alligned occupancy matrixes (3) followup analysis and results visualization. \r\nFor the moment we don't have a wrapper to run all 3 steps automatically so, each step should be executed separately and, in turn, consists of several intermediate steps.\r\n\r\nWe will provide a testing BAM file, command line bash file, and example output in ./test. Below is a set of commands that runs \"test.bam\" through NucTools pipeline:\r\n\r\n        $ samtools sort -n ./test/test_sorted.bam ./test/test.bam\r\n        $ bedtools bamtobed -i ./test/test_sorted.bam | pigz > ./test/test_sorted.bed.gz\r\n        $ extend_SE_reads.pl -in ./test/test.bed -out ./test/test.ext.bed.gz\r\n        $ extract_chr_bed.pl -in ./test/test.ext.bed.gz -out test/BED -d ./test -p chr \r\n        $ bed2occupancy_average.pl -in ./test/BED -odir ./test/OCC -dir -use -w 10\r\n        $ aggregate_profile.pl -reg genome_annotation.txt -idC 0 -chrC 4 -strC 7 -sC 8 -eC 9 -pbN -lsN -lS 75000000 -chr 1 -al ./test/OCC/chr1.test.occ_matrix -av ./test/OCC/chr1.test.aggregate -in ./test/OCC/chr1.test.w10.occ.gz -upD 1000 -downD 1000\r\n\r\nIn the example above test.bam file is sorted by the reads names and converted to test_sorted.bed.gz file. As long as in the example case we are dealing with single-end ilumina sequencing reads, with expected read length of 100, we extending each read to the length of 100 using extend_SE_reads.pl. Resulting whole genome BED file is splitted to chromosomes with extract_chr_bed.pl script and all per-chromosome bed files are converted to OCC files with bed2occupancy_average.pl, using running window 10 (use -w 0 for bep-base resolution). Last step is to generate an aggregate profiles using aggregate_profile.pl script \r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n## Interpreting Results\r\n\r\nNucTools bed2occupancy_average.pl scritp generates 2 types of the output. The file containing one column of numbers, corresponding to an aggregate profile (could be visualized, for example in Excel) and the tab-delimited text file containing all occupancy data for each region of interest (or transcript), aligned at annotated strat. These matrixes can be later visualized with our ClusterMaps Building Tool.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n## Additional information\r\n\r\nAdditional information, publications references and short description of each script from the toolbox can be found here:\r\n- http://www.generegulation.info/index.php/nuctools (external link)\r\n- https://homeveg.github.io/nuctools/ (GitHub pages)\r\n\r\n**PLEASE NOTE**:\r\n*we are currently preparing manuscript and will add here more information, usage instruction and test data set soon.\r\nThe project is under development now.*\r\n\r\n### Planned modifications\r\n\r\nThere are several changes has been planned and partially implemented:\r\n\r\n- implement GZIP support for all input/output files generated by the pipeline scripts\r\n- implement gapped OCC format support to all relevant scripts\r\n- extend NucTools documentation and usage examples with Perl POD package\r\n- unify pipeline scripts input parameters using Perl GETOPT package\r\n\r\n### Future possible modifications\r\n\r\n- BAM files support\r\n- parallel processing (beautiful codes snippets for implementation of parallel processing of BAM files with Perl one can find here: https://genomebytes.wordpress.com/2013/07/24/multi-thread-access-of-bam-files-using-perl-and-samtools/ )\r\n- NucTools automated package installation with make\r\n\r\n### Developers: \r\nYevhen Vainshtein and Vladimir B.
